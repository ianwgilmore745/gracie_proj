            I know this is a little stupid and cringy, but I wanted to do something personal and creative for you and this is about the extent of my creativity. I really hope you like it.</p>

            I am so lucky to have you and I am so happy that we get to spend our first valentines together. You make me so happy and in a little over a month we get to have our 1 year together. You make my life so much better in so many ways. I am really grateful to have someone as beautiful, smart, funny, and caring as you. I love you so much.
            </p>

            

            <p id="letter">The moment you came into my life I was so much happier. Even as my closest friend you were so fun and kind and I loved every second I spent with you. You were pretty much the exact opposite of me and I loved it. You made me want to be more social and friendly and be a better person in general. You still do. Seeing how proactive you are and how much you take initiative to set yourself up for your future has made me want to follow suit because I admire it so much. I am so proud of you and the person that you are. I am so lucky that you decided to date me.  </p>

            <p id="letter">I was so excited our first night together. I'd gotten to be close with you for so long that I knew exactly who you were. You were the most beautiful, dedicated, smart, driven, and funny person I had ever met. Every time I was around you I was happy and I had fun. But dating you has been ever than I had imagined. You are so caring and you are happy to reassure me and make time for me even though you're one of the busiest people I know. You push me out of my comfort zone and you don't get upset with me for being boring and you force me to experience more. I know we have one year coming up but making this was a nice reminder of our history together and I got to reflect on the past year. I hope you know that you have made it the best year of my life. Happy Valentines Day.
